# image_converter

Example result located in "images/result.png"

Default file selection is limited to jpg, png, and gif files. Other types may work but it's not guaranteed.

Generated images are saved into the images folder as "result.png" when the program is closed

The program uses the text from "characters.txt" to generate images. Changing the characters in this file will also change the characters used by the program.

Large character resolutions can result in lag and large file sizes. Stick to <300 for good viewing, <1000 to avoid crashes.

Character resolutions >300 can result in images which are larger than the viewing screen. If this happens, just alt-tab to a different window and close the program. Saved images should still be fine.

The results look best when the background of the selected image is a solid color.
